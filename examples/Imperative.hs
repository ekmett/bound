-- PART 1: We want to model a tiny assembly language.

--   %0 = add 1 2
--   %1 = add %0 %0
--   ret %1
--
-- Add binds a fresh variable, and its operands can either be literals or
-- previously-bound variables. Ret must be the last instruction.
--
-- Operand is monadic, traversable, and satisfies all the other requirements in
-- order to be used with bound. But this is not sufficient, since Operand is
-- not the whole language: we also need to define Prog, the sequence of
-- instructions.

  pure = Var
  (<*>) = ap

  return = pure
  Lit i >>= _ = Lit i
  Var x >>= f = f x

-- The following definition correctly models the instructions and their free
-- variables. But since the Var in Operand cannot be replaced with a Prog, this
-- definition is not monadic, and so we cannot manipulate the (Scope () Prog a)
-- using bound's functions. This defeats the point of using Scope at all!
--

--           (Scope () Prog a) -- one more bound variable, available
--                             -- in the rest of the program
--
-- The sideways trick is to replace the Operand constructor with a (* -> *) type
-- parameter. Instantiating this with the real Operand will allow Operand to
-- access the same free variables as Prog. But if we instantiate this with
-- (Scope () Operand) instead, then the operands will have access to one extra
-- bound variable! This way, we can bind fresh variables which can only be used
-- inside the operands, and not in Prog.

-- The fact that the variables are not available in Prog after they are bound
-- might seem strange, and we'll fix this in part 2, but it is actually a good
-- thing. We want to be able to replace those variables with operand values, and
-- that would not be possible if variables were allowed to appear inside Prog
-- but outside of an operand.

-- PART 2: Here's a slightly more complicated language.
--
--   %0 = add 1 2
--   %1 = add %0 %0
--   swp %0 %1
--   ret %1
--
-- The new swp command swaps the contents of two variables, so the two arguments
-- must be previously-bound variables, they cannot be literals. This time the
-- naÃ¯ve definition looks like this:
--
--   data Prog' a
--     = Ret' (Operand a)
--     | Swp' a a
--            (Prog' a)
--     | Add' (Operand a) (Operand a)
--            (Scope () Prog' a)
--
-- If we apply the sideways trick to this definition, the newly-bound variables
-- will only be available in the operands, and so it won't be possible to call
-- swp on them. The first step towards a solution is to add seemingly-useless
-- Identity wrappers:
--
--   data Prog' a
--     = Ret' (Operand a)
--     | Swp' (Identity a) (Identity a)
--            (Prog' a)
--     | Add' (Operand a) (Operand a)
--            (Scope () Prog' a)
--
-- We can now apply the sideways trick twice: once for Operand, and once for
-- Identity. This gives us a lot of control: we can bind fresh variables which
-- can only be used inside the operands, we can bind fresh variables which can
-- be used inside Prog but not inside the operands, and as required for this
-- example, we can bind fresh variables which can be used in both.
