Goals
-----

This library provides convenient combinators for working with "locally-nameless" terms. These can be useful
when writing a type checker, evalator, parser, or pretty printer for terms that contain binders like forall
or lambda, as they ease the task of avoiding variable capture and testing for alpha-equivalence.

See [the documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bound) on hackage for more information, but here is an example:

```haskell
import Bound
import Prelude.Extras

infixl 9 :@
data Exp a = V a | Exp a :@ Exp a | Lam (Scope () Exp a)
  deriving (Eq,Ord,Show,Read,Functor,Foldable,Traversable)

instance Eq1 Exp
instance Ord1 Exp
instance Show1 Exp
instance Read1 Exp
instance Applicative Exp where pure = V; (<*>) = ap

instance Monad Exp where
  return = V
  V a      >>= f = f a
  (x :@ y) >>= f = (x >>= f) :@ (y >>= f)
  Lam e    >>= f = Lam (e >>>= f)

lam :: Eq a => a -> Exp a -> Exp a
lam v b = Lam (abstract1 v b)

whnf :: Exp a -> Exp a
whnf (f :@ a) = case whnf f of
  Lam b -> whnf (instantiate1 a b)
  f'    -> f' :@ a
whnf e = e
```

   There are longer examples in the [examples/ folder](https://github.com/ekmett/bound/tree/master/examples).
